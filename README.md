# ImageForgeryDetection


This repository contains my work on Image splice forgery detection using deep learning. This is part of m.tech project in IIT KGP.

For details : See report and presentation on the topic.

Points:

1. Keep the code in "./code" folder.
2. Keep the "CASIA2" folder (keep the name same) in  "./data" folder.
3. Keep “Au” (Authentic image folder) & “Tp” (Tampered image folder) in “./data” folder.
4. All libraries used are updated.


Run as:

for RNN:
python create_dataset_csv_file.py
Python RNN.py 

for CNN:
python create_dataset_csv_file.py
Python CNN.py
